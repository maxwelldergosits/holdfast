TARGET AUDIENCE: New parents, expecting parents, parents with young children

IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
A warm, emotional scene showing printed photos of baby milestones and family moments: first smiles, tiny hands and feet, bedtime stories, family portraits. The photos should be displayed in a cozy nursery setting or family living space, maybe on a coffee table with soft lighting. Include some baby items like toys or blankets. Warm, nurturing, love-filled aesthetic.

AD COPY:

You have 847 photos of your baby on your phone.

Last week's first smile attempt (blurry but cute). Those tiny hands grabbing your finger. The face they make right before they cry.

You keep taking more because, honestly, how could you not? Every day they do something new.

But when was the last time you actually looked at the photos from two months ago?

They're all just sitting there. Which is kind of sad when you think about it.

HoldFast prints your 5 favorite baby photos each month and sends them to you. Real photos you can stick on the fridge or show your mom without scrolling through 800 others.

$10 a month. Way easier than trying to remember to print them yourself.
