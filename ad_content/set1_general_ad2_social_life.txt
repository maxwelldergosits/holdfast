TARGET AUDIENCE: General 20-35 year olds, frequent Instagram users, party-goers, social media active

IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
A lifestyle shot showing someone in their apartment/room with printed photos displayed on a wall or desk - showing friend group photos, date nights, concerts, brunch pics, and social moments. The person should be young, stylish, and genuinely smiling while looking at the photos. Modern, Instagram-worthy apartment aesthetic.

AD COPY:

You know that photo where everyone's laughing and you can't even remember what was so funny?

Or the one from last weekend where you actually look good and so does everyone else?

Those photos exist somewhere in your camera roll. Probably next to 47 screenshots you forgot to delete.

Look, I'm not saying you need to print everything. But maybe the really good ones shouldn't just live on your phone forever?

HoldFast sends you 5 printed photos every month. You pick them, we print them, they show up in your mailbox. $10 total.

Kind of like getting a little package of your own memories.
