TARGET AUDIENCE: New parents, parents with toddlers, busy families

IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
A touching comparison showing the passage of time: printed photos arranged chronologically showing a child growing up (newborn → crawling → walking → playing). Set in a family home environment, maybe on a mantle or family photo wall. Include parents looking at the photos with nostalgic expressions. Emotional, heartwarming, time-passage aesthetic.

AD COPY:

Remember when your kid was tiny and everyone said "enjoy it, it goes so fast"?

You probably rolled your eyes. The sleepless nights felt eternal.

But now they're walking around, talking back, and you're like... wait, when did that happen?

You've got thousands of photos documenting it all. Somewhere. Mixed in with screenshots, grocery lists, and 47 attempts at the same family selfie.

What if you actually had some of those photos printed? Like, the good ones. So you could see the progression without digging through your camera roll.

HoldFast prints your 5 favorite family photos each month. You pick them, they arrive in your mailbox. $10.

Not life-changing, but kind of nice to have real photos sitting around again.
