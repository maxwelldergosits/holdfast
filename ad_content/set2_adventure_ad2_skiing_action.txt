IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
An action-packed winter scene featuring printed photos of skiing/snowboarding moments: powder shots, alpine landscapes, action sequences, and mountain lodge scenes. Display the photos against a backdrop of ski gear, mountain cabin interior, or snowy outdoor setting. High-energy, adrenaline-filled aesthetic with winter sports equipment visible.

AD COPY:

Best powder day of the season. Your buddy got the perfect action shot of you carving through fresh snow.

You posted it to Instagram. Your mom liked it. A few ski friends dropped fire emojis.

And now it's buried somewhere in your camera roll with 2,000 other photos from this winter.

Seems like a waste of a good photo, right?

Maybe some of those shots deserve to exist outside your phone. Like, actual printed photos you can look at without scrolling through everything else.

HoldFast prints your 5 favorite photos each month. Mountain sports, landscapes, whatever. Just pick them and they show up in your mailbox. $10.
