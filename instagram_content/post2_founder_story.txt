The story behind HoldFast üëá

I'm Maxwell, and I take photos everywhere I go. Hiking with friends, visiting my parents, random Tuesday adventures...

But here's the problem: I NEVER looked at them again.

They just lived on my phone, forgotten. üòî

One day I got tired of letting my favorite memories fade away, so I started printing my best shots. Suddenly, seeing them on my wall brought back all those feelings - the laughter, the joy, the connections.

But the process was SO annoying:
‚ùå Scrolling through 1000s of photos
‚ùå Choosing which printing service  
‚ùå Picking sizes, papers, formats
‚ùå Actually remembering to do it

So I built HoldFast to remove all that friction. Now I just focus on capturing the moments that matter. üì∏

Because your memories deserve to be held, not just stored.

What's your favorite printed photo memory?
